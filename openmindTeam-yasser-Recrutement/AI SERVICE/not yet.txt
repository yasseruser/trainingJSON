 build a system that can analyze candidate 
profiles and job offers, then calculate a
 percentage match between them based on
 various factors such as skills, experience,
 and preferences outlined in the documents.

Data Preprocessing:

Extract text from the PDF documents containing candidate profiles and job offers. We can use libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfminer in Python for this task.
Preprocess the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization to standardize the text.

Feature Extraction:

Identify key features from the candidate profiles and job offers such as skills, experience, education, location, etc.
Using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe) to represent the text data numerically.

Matching Algorithm:
One of the most useful and powerful matching algorithms for this task is the cosine similarity.

Scoring:

After computing the similarity between the candidate profile and the job offer, assign a score or percentage that represents the degree of match.
We might want to weigh different features differently based on their importance in the job offer.
